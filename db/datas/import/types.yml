    The Thraex wore the same protective armour as the hoplomachi with a broad rimmed helmet that enclosed the entire head, distinguished by a stylized griffin on the protome or front of the crest, a small round or square-shaped shield, and two thigh-length greaves. His weapon was the Thracian curved sword. They were introduced as replacements for the Gauls after Gaul made peace with Rome. They commonly fought Myrmillones or Hoplomachi.

    The murmillo wore a helmet with a stylised fish on the crest, as well as an arm guard, a loincloth and belt, a gaiter on his right leg, thick wrappings covering the tops of his feet, and a very short greave with an indentation for the padding at the top of the feet. They are heavily armoured gladiators: the murmillo carried a gladius and a tall, oblong shield in the legionary style.
